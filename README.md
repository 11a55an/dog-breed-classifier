## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify dog breeds based on input images. We will be using CNNs, a popular deep learning architecture for image classification tasks.

## Requirements

To run the code, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- [Dog Breed Dataset](#dataset)

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib pandas
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/11a55an/dog-breed-classifier.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the [Requirements](#requirements) section.
3. Obtain the Dog Breed Dataset and organize it appropriately.
4. Train the model using instructions in the notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset is taken from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinehorng/dogbreedidfromcomp](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinehorng/dogbreedidfromcomp)
